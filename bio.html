<p>Scott Miller looks different in pictures than he does in real life. It is an amazing ability passed down from generation to generation.
    It is a skill to protect us from our enemies
</p>
<br>
<p>Scott Miller likes, excel spreadsheets which he can manipulate with python or sql. Data analysis, statistics and physics. 
    He can also be found jamming on his planner or taking long walks on the beach, with a horse, which he doesn't ride because he is an animal activist
