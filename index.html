    Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed. Each of these visualization pages has a graph showing the relationship between 
    either Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, or Wind Speed with Latitude. There is also a paragraph describing its significance
    for each visualization page. Here is the requirements for the homework as described by gitlab <a href="https://umn.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-Minnesota-Boot-Camp/MINSTP201808DATA2/tree/master/12-Web/Homework">HTML, CSS HW</a>

<p>The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
    
        Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
        Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
